The church traces its origins to the global Foursquare movement, which began in 1923 under the visionary leadership of Aimee Semple McPherson. This movement reached Nigeria in 1955, thanks to the pioneering efforts of Rev. and Mrs. Harold Curtis, who established the foundation for Foursquare's growth across the nation. Located in Ikate, Lagos, our church is dedicated to spreading the message of hope, love, and salvation. Over the years, we have become a spiritual home for individuals and families seeking a deeper connection with God and a supportive community.",

The term 'Foursquare' symbolizes balance, stability, and completeness, reflecting the church's commitment to proclaiming Jesus Christ as the Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Soon-Coming King. These four roles form the cornerstone of the church's doctrine, emphasizing the transformative power of the Gospel in every aspect of life. Guided by Hebrews 13:8, 'Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever,' the church remains steadfast in its mission to spread the unchanging truth of God's Word.",
